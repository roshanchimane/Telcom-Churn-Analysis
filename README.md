# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn patterns to identify key factors affecting retention and attrition. Using data-driven insights and visualizations, the study provides actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Key Insights
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26% of customers have churned.
- **Contract Type Impact:** Month-to-month contracts have a 45% churn rate, whereas one- and two-year contracts have significantly lower churn rates (11%).
- **Demographics:** Senior citizens churn at 41%, while younger customers churn at 22%.
- **Internet Service Impact:** Fiber-optic users have a 30% churn rate compared to 18% for DSL users.
- **Bundled Services:** Customers with additional services (e.g., security, tech support) churn at 15%, while those without churn at 40%.

## Data Visualizations
The project includes the following visual tools:
- **Bar Charts:** Churn distribution across various customer segments.
- **Heatmaps:** Correlation analysis between churn and different influencing factors.
- **Pie Charts:** Breakdown of churn percentages based on contract types and demographics.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Encourage Long-Term Contracts:** Provide incentives for annual subscriptions to lower churn.
2. **Promote Service Bundling:** Encourage customers to opt for additional services to improve retention.
3. **Enhance Fiber-Optic Service:** Address customer dissatisfaction to reduce churn rates.
4. **Personalized Retention Strategies:** Implement targeted engagement for high-risk customer segments.
